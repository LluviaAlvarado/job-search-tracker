## About Job Search Tracker

Job Search Tracker is a simple web application that you can run locally to easily keep track of your job applications during your job search journey, like saving the specific CV sent for a job, role description, interview information and expected salary, all while keeping track of dates for each step in the application process.

To run you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Docker
- PHP 8.x
- Node >= 18

Then just start the application by running the _run_ script with this command inside the root folder:

`sh ./run.sh`

You can now start using the application in your browser on http://localhost:8000/
